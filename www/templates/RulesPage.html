        The Connect 4 Board Game Rules are easy to understand. In fact, the goal is in the name, to win: connect Four</p> 
        <p class="text-justify lead">All you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as the inferior game Tic tac toe. This can be
        done horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
        
        <p class="text-justify lead">Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time. This will
        give you a chance to either build your row, or stop your opponent from getting four in a row.</p>

        <p class="text-justify lead">The game is over either when you or your friend reaches four in a row, or when all forty two slots are filled,
        ending in a stalemate. If you and your friend decide to play again, the loser typically goes first.
