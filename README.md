# ConnectFour
### Connect Four Web Game
#### Final project for a JavaScript- and jQuery-course.


## TODO:
#### Refactor all CSS and HTML-classes
- Chaos in style.css

#### Clean up other unnecessary code 
- Id's that are not in use, parent-divs not needed etc.

#### Standardize method- and variable-calls
- Different use of e.g App.game.board.**something** and this.board.**something**.

#### Re-work color switching of slots
- After the adding of **player.color** (to hot-fix the possibility of human interference with bots), the whole idea of a playerTurn-variable that doubles as color for slots feels unnecessary.

#### Re-work of classes
- Break out code to more classes and implement more OOP throghout the whole project.

#### Change hover function of slots and arrows
- After getting input from product owner and testers(Hej Mamma!), we've realized that our hover function actually
confuses players instead of helping them.

#### Re-work of overall styling
- Standardize margins, padding and centering

#### Create an intelligent bot
- With the inspiration from Wincheck.js, but the other way around!

#### Add network capability
- With inspiration from other projects, adding functionality for network gaming and chat.
